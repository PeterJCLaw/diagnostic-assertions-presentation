# Diagnostic Assertions: How to make reading, writing & fixing tests easier

Presentation notebook for a lightning talk I gave at [PyCon UK 2017](http://2017.pyconuk.org/).

## Format

The presentation takes the form of a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook
using [RISE](https://damianavila.github.io/RISE/) to render the slides in a
"live" fashion. It turned out that I didn't use the live features at all, so
it's probably possible to use the more standard `nbconvert` mechanisms to
generate slides too.
