# Diagnostic Assertions: How to make reading, writing & fixing tests easier

Presentation notebook for a lightning talk I gave at PyCon UK 2017.

## Format

The presentation takes the form of a jupyter notebook using RISE to render the
slides in a "live" fashion. It turned out that I didn't use the live features at
all, so it's probably possible to use the more standard `nbconvert` mechanisms
to generate slides too.
