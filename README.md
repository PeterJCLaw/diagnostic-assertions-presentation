# Diagnostic Assertions: How to make reading, writing & fixing tests easier

Presentation notebook for a lightning talk I gave at [PyCon UK 2017](http://2017.pyconuk.org/) and subsequently elsewhere.

## Format

The presentation takes the form of a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook
converted to slides via `jupyter nbconvert`:

``` console
jupyter nbconvert diagnostic-assertions.ipynb --to slides --SlidesExporter.reveal_scroll=true --post serve
```

Or just run `make`.
